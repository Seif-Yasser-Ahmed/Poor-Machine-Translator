## English-to-French Machine Translator: Seq2Seq without Attention

This notebook implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for machine translation from English to French, using a basic encoder-decoder architecture without attention mechanisms.

### Key Features

- Preprocessing of parallel English-French corpus
- Encoder-decoder LSTM model implementation
- Training pipeline
- Inference for translating new English sentences to French

Ideal for understanding core Seq2Seq concepts in neural machine translation.
